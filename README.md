# Teacher Directory
## _ A client has requested we create a Directory app containing all the Teachers in a given school.
 
## Features
- Teachers can have the same first name and last name but their email address should be unique
- A teacher can teach no more than 5 subjects
- The directory should allow Teachers to filtered by first letter of last name or by subject.
- You should be able to click on a teach in the directory and open up the profile page. From there you
can see all details for the teacher.
- An Importer will be needed to allow Teachers details to be added to the system in bulk. This should
be secure so only logged in users can run the importer.
- The CSV attached contains a list of teacher who need to be uploaded as well as the filename for the
profile image. Profile images are in the attached Zip file.
- If an image is not present for the profile then you should use a default placeholder image.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [Gulp] - the streaming build system
- [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML
to Markdown converter
- [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

see the install guid on .github/workflow

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh

    - name: psycopg2 prerequisites
      run: sudo apt-get install python3-dev libpq-dev
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |

        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run migrations
      run: python app/manage.py migrate
    - name: Run tests
      run: python app/manage.py test 
```


```sh
If Docker installed:
docker-compose up
```

For production environments...

```sh
use .env file in the BASE_DIR

```

## Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:

```sh
node app
```

Second Tab:

```sh
gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:

```sh
karma test
```

#### Building for source

For production release:

```sh
gulp build --prod
```

Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:

```sh
gulp build dist --prod
```

## Docker

Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the
Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to
build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```

This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies.
Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual
version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on
your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to
port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart=always --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --name=dillinger <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

> Note: `--capt-add=SYS-ADMIN` is required for PDF rendering.

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```
